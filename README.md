## 📌 Project Overview

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing **7,000+ monthly customer support tickets** across email, phone, chat, and social media channels for a SaaS company.

- **Total Monthly Tickets:** 7,000+
- **Channels Analyzed:** Email, Phone, Chat, Social Media
- **Ticket Categories:** Refund requests, cancellations, product inquiries, technical issues, billing inquiries

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1. Resolution Time Improvement
- Average resolution time **decreased from 12 hours to 7.5 hours** over the tracking period
- Represents a **37.5% improvement** in response efficiency
- Downward trend indicates successful process improvements

### 2. Channel Performance
- **Email** generated the highest ticket volume (~1,750 tickets)
- Ticket volume evenly distributed across all channels
- **Recommendation:** Maintain multi-channel support staffing

### 3. Ticket Type Analysis
- **Refund requests and cancellations** had the longest resolution times (8-9 hours)
- **Product inquiries and billing** resolved faster (~7 hours average)
- **Critical finding:** Refund/cancellation tickets likely require manager approval, creating bottlenecks

### 4. Customer Satisfaction Patterns

- **Refund requests and technical issues** showed lower satisfaction (2.9/5)
- Customers waiting longest for refunds were least satisfied

## 💡 Recommendations Delivered

1. **Streamline refund approval process**  
   Reduce manager approval steps to decrease resolution time from 9 hours to 6 hours (33% improvement target)

2. **Prioritize technical issue tickets**  
   Customer satisfaction drops on technical issues; recommend dedicated tech support specialist

3. **Maintain multi-channel support**  
   Ticket volume evenly distributed; avoid consolidating channels

4. **Monitor satisfaction weekly**  
   Set up automated alerts when CSAT drops below 3.0 for any ticket type
